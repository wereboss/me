I was not particularly good at Math, but I remember enjoying it in my formative years. One reason could be that I used to enjoy rhymes & poems and the multiplication tables seemed to be as more songs, or something which you rattle away, keeping rhythm, learning by _**rote**_.

As it with any aspect of life, my perspective changed through the years. From learning tables "by heart" , from learning algebraic fomulas, solving theorms, to complicated rules in calculus, in statistics.
But once I was out of the " Learning Math to get marks" phase, it suddenly started getting interesting. Learning the history and anedotes behind various strides in Math,

<font size="4">Q</font><font size="2"> 2.</font>: Do animals process math the same as we do?<br/>
<font size="4">Q</font><font size="2"> 3.</font>: Could thought/technical prowess improve without math?<br/>
<font size="4">Q</font><font size="2"> 4.</font>: Is math an eventuality for evolution?<br/>
</div>

Above were the tinders which started me on this journey. As is with any journey, it helps to get the initial bearing
