Every bud hopes to be  
 A flower.  
Every seed hopes to be  
 A tree.  
Every stream hopes to be  
 A river.  
Every lake hopes to be  
 A sea.

Every raindrop wants to  
 Be hail.  
Every stone wants to be  
 A mountain.  
Every wave wants to be  
 A tsunami.  
Every breeze wants to be  
 A hurricane.

Every bug wants to be  
 A butterfly.  
Every fly wants to be  
 A bee.  
Even I take some time off  
 To wonder,  
What would I wanna be?  
 ??

Every asteroid wishes to be  
 The moon.  
Poor thing ends up as  
 A meteor.  
Every cat wishes to be  
 A lion.  
Unlike its Cousin,  
 It can't roar.

Every Kiwi wishes to be  
 A bird.  
But sadly it can't find  
 It's wings.  
Every fish wishes to snort like  
 A whale.  
But it has Gills,  
 Not Nostrils.

So I may wish to be  
 Someone else.  
Someone else I may wish  
 To be.  
Someone perhaps greater or  
 Better than me,  
Whom nature created  
 Differently.

Someone whom I may be  
 Related to  
But has a different lifestyle  
 Totally.  
Someone who has different rules  
 Of living,  
Or someone who sets down and  
 Dies differently.

So,  
I go change myself to resemble  
 His liking.  
So,  
I set forth and hamper  
 His and My Individuality,  
When I can save  
 All the trouble,  
When I can simply  
 Wish to be Me.

:)
