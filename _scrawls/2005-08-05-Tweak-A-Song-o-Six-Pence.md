<div><font size="8">M</font>any of you would still remember this rhyme … We had it during our nursery years ... Those sweet jingles are not that easy to forget...</div>

<div><font size="8">W</font>ell… to begin with ... I dont know why .. but I waz kinda humming it all da way to the office 1 day … I hadn't reached the bus stop yet ... but suddenly I hit upon a Parody … I was not trying to make a parody .. But somehow ... the words which just occured to me .. in that tune .... made a funny sorta sense .. U know .. the same way that "Misheard Lyrics" get formed ... You are least bothered about the lyrics .. but the tune matters .. and just so that you may fill in the blanks .. you use the first rhyming word that comes to your mind ... If ur attentive enough ... a parody is born .... Trust me .. it never fails !!</div>

<div><font size="8">M</font>y colleagues in the company bus would have definitely worried about the foolish grin that I sported all the way to office ... Believe it or not ... as I entered the building .. I hit upon a second one !! ... Wait ... This can't be happening ... But ... these words do fit in, man !! ... Interesting ... Damn !! .. I have to write this stuff down ... and so I did.</div>

Read all the three now ….

## The Original Rhyme

Sing a song of six pence,  
A pocket full of Rye.  
Four and Twenty black Birds,  
Baked in a Pie.

When the pie was opened  
the birds began to Sing  
Wasn’t it a dainty dish to set before the King.

The King was in his counting house,  
Counting all his money.  
The queen was in her parlor,  
Eating bread and honey.

The maid was in the garden,  
Hanging all the clothes.  
There came a Black bird and snapped off her Nose !!

## My Parody # 1

Sing'a Song'o Suspense  
I’ve gotta murderer to find  
Four of family suspects  
Standing in a line.

When the case wz opened,  
The dead began to sing.  
By the time this rhyme ends,  
I’ve gotta murderer to bring.

The Bro wz in da Study,  
Cleaning out his BF Gun  
The wife wz in da Parlor  
Teaching shooting to her son.

The maid wz cleaning the bloody knife  
That could've struck the blow.  
God Damn her…I’ll blame the Butler  
Its alweyz the Butler .. Don’t U kno !!

## My Parody # 2

Sing'a song to a Sick Friend  
On the verge of Beddy-Bye.  
Four Old knobby Vultures  
Waiting for him to die.

When my little rhyme stops,  
They’ll begin to sing.  
“Welcome to the Netherworld”,  
“Let us take you to our King”

The Prince of darkness sitting on his Throne  
Busy counting off the Dead.  
“You Lousy Birds !!, I’m short of One”  
“Quick !!, Bring me his Head”

The Vultures look at my Friend,  
“Buddy, This is it.. the End of all Shows”  
So I Smacked’em, Packed’em both to the Netherland  
With broken wings and Broken Nose.
